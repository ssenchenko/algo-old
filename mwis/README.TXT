The task in this problem is to run the dynamic programming algorithm (and the reconstruction procedure) 
on this data set (../../test_data/c3w3_mwis.txt). 
The question is: of the vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 17, 117, 517, and 997, 
which ones belong to the maximum-weight independent set? 
(By "vertex 1" we mean the first vertex of the graph---there is no vertex 0.) 
Give your answer in for of an 8-bit string, where the ith bit should be 1 if the ith of these 
8 vertices is in the maximum-weight independent set, and 0 otherwise. 
For example, if you think that the vertices 1, 4, 17, and 517 are in the maximum-weight independent 
set and the other four vertices are not, then ythe answer is 10011010.
