TASK 1:
Code for the greedy algorithm of Huffman coding.
Input file contains weights of every symbol of the alphabet.
The task is to run the Huffman coding algorithm on this data set.
What is the maximum length of a codeword in the resulting Huffman code?

TASK 2:
Continuing the previous problem, what is the minimum length of a codeword in your Huffman code?
