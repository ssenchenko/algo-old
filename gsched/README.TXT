TASK 1:
run the greedy algorithm that schedules jobs in decreasing order of the difference (weight - length). 
Recall from lecture that this algorithm is not always optimal. 
IMPORTANT: if two jobs have equal difference (weight - length), you should schedule the job with higher weight first. 
Beware: if you break ties in a different way, you are likely to get the wrong answer. 
You should report the sum of weighted completion times of the resulting schedule -- a positive integer.

TASK 2:
run the greedy algorithm that schedules jobs (optimally) in decreasing order of the ratio (weight/length). 
In this algorithm, it does not matter how you break ties. 
You should report the sum of weighted completion times of the resulting schedule -- a positive integer.
